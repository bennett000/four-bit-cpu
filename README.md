Four Bit CPU
============

Ever wonder how a CPU works? Do you want to learn the answers the hard way?

If so this is the repository for you.

## The Goal

Build a "macroprocessor" turing machine that can execute an assembly language.

How hard could it be?

## Inspirations

* [Simple CPU](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~mjf/simple_cpu/index.html "Simple CPU with FPGA"), on which this project is _heavily_ based.  Thanks [Mike](mike.freeman@york.ac.uk "Mike Freeman, York")
* [Mega Processor](http://www.megaprocessor.com/ "The Mega Processor"), cemented the desire to stick to four bits.  Also had great retrospectives that highlighted the strenghts of Mike Freeman's emphasis on "Clock Enable" circuitry
* [All About Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/ "All About Circuits Electronic Textbook") wonderful text for explaining the fundamentals of electricity and electronics


## Assumed Knowledge

It will be challenging to list all the assumed knowledge here. We've been fiddling with software for decades, but electronics not so much.

* Knowledge of some form of computer programming.  Assembly would be nice but the concepts of a higher level language like Python or JavaScript are very transferrable
* Basic knowledge of electricity, think simple pipe analogy, but not much knowledge of semi-conductors
* Basic knowledge of discrete mathematics, think truth tables, but not necessarily how to do algebra with discrete math (although that helps)
